The goal of this stage of the process is to uncover important factors that could influence the outcome of the project.

    "\n",
    "- It also is limited to people who care to take the test to begin with, which will likely scew the data in favour of people that are higher in traits of Openess due to a higher interest in more abstract topics. This is also shown in the average Openess score of all users that took the test being above 50% (Will be shown in the describe data section.)\n",
